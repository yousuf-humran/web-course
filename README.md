# Web Course – Web Fundamentals

This repository contains my learning progress and practice work from the  
**Web Fundamentals course (HTML, CSS, Git & GitHub)**.

The course is structured in milestones and modules, focusing on building a
strong foundation in web development.

## 💻 Important Git Commands

Here are some essential Git commands for initializing, managing, and pushing your projects to GitHub:

`git init`
`git add .`
`git commit -m "first commit"`
`git branch -M main`
`git remote add origin https://github.com/yousuf-humran/web-course.git`
`git push -u origin main `

> These commands are fundamental for version control and keeping your projects synced with GitHub.
